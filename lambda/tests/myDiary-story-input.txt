say = Hello Alien, here is the story for you. The Tale of Peter Rabbit. ';
say = say + 'ONCE upon a time there were four little Rabbits, and their names were— Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter. ';
say = say + 'They lived with their Mother in a sand-bank, underneath the root of a very big fir tree. ';
say = say + '"NOW, my dears," said old Mrs. Rabbit one morning, "you may go into the fields or down the lane, but dont go into Mr. McGregors garden: ';
say = say + 'your Father had an accident there; he was put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor. NOW run along, and dont get into mischief. I am going out." ';
say = say + 'THEN old Mrs. Rabbit took a basket and her umbrella, to the bakers. She bought a loaf of brown bread and five currant buns. ' ;
say = say + 'FLOPSY, Mopsy, and Cottontail, who were good little bunnies, went down the lane to gather blackberries; ';
say = say + 'BUT Peter, who was very naughty, ran straight away to Mr. McGregors garden and squeezed under the gate! ';
say = say + 'FIRST he ate some lettuces and some French beans; and then he ate some radishes; ';
say = say + 'AND then, feeling rather sick, he went to look for some parsley.';
say = say + 'BUT round the end of a cucumber frame, whom should he meet but Mr. McGregor! ';
say = say + 'MR. McGREGOR was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages, but he jumped up and ran after Peter, waving a rake ';
say = say + ' and calling out, "Stop thief!" PETER was most dreadfully frightened; he rushed all over the garden, for he had forgotten ';
say = say + ' the way back to the gate. He lost one of his shoes among the cabbages, and the other shoe amongst the potatoes. ';
say = say + 'AFTER losing them, he ran on four legs and went faster, so that I think he might have got away altogether if he had not ';
say = say + 'unfortunately run into a gooseberry net, and got caught by the large buttons on his jacket. It was a blue jacket with ';
say = say + 'brass buttons, quite new. PETER gave himself up for lost, and shed big tears; but his sobs were overheard by some friendly ';
say = say + 'sparrows, who flew to him in great excitement, and implored him to exert himself. ';
say = say + 'MR. McGREGOR came up with a sieve, which he intended to pop upon the top of Peter; but Peter wriggled out just in time, ';
say = say + 'leaving his jacket behind him. AND rushed into the toolshed, and jumped into a can. It would have been a beautiful thing ';
say = say + 'to hide in, if it had not had so much water in it. ';
say = say + 'MR. McGREGOR was quite sure that Peter was somewhere in the toolshed, perhaps hidden underneath a flower-pot. ';
say = say + 'He began to turn them over carefully, looking under each. Presently Peter sneezed— "Kertyschoo!" Mr. McGregor was after him ';
say = say + 'in no time, AND tried to put his foot upon Peter, who jumped out of a window, upsetting three plants. The window was too ';
say = say + 'small for Mr. McGregor, and he was tired of running after Peter. He went back to his work. PETER sat down to rest; he was ';
say = say + 'out of breath and trembling with fright, and he had not the least idea which way to go. Also he was very damp with sitting ';
say = say + 'in that can. After a time he began to wander about, going lippity— lippity—not very fast, and looking all around. ';
say = say + 'HE found a door in a wall; but it was locked, and there was no room for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath. ';
say = say + 'An old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep, carrying peas and beans to her family in the wood. Peter asked ';
say = say + 'her the way to the gate, but she had such a large pea in her mouth that she could not answer. She only shook her head at him. ';
say = say + 'Peter began to cry. THEN he tried to find his way straight across the garden, but he became more and more puzzled. Presently, ';
say = say + 'he came to a pond where Mr. McGregor filled his water-cans. A white cat was staring at some gold-fish; she sat very, ';
say = say + 'very still, but now and then the tip of her tail twitched as if it were alive. Peter thought it best to go away without ';
say = say + 'speaking to her; he had heard about cats from his cousin, little Benjamin Bunny. ';
say = say + 'HE went back towards the tool-shed, but suddenly, quite close to him, he heard the noise of a hoe—scr-r-ritch, scratch, ';
say = say + 'scratch, scritch. Peter scuttered underneath the bushes. But presently, as nothing happened, he came out, and climbed upon ';
say = say + 'a wheelbarrow, and peeped over. The first thing he saw was Mr. McGregor hoeing onions. His back was turned towards Peter, ';
say = say + 'and beyond him was the gate! PETER got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow, and started running as fast as he could go, ';
say = say + 'along a straight walk behind some black-currant bushes. Mr. McGregor caught sight of him at the corner, but Peter did not care. ';
say = say + ' He slipped underneath the gate, and was safe at last in the wood outside the garden. ';
say = say + 'MR. McGREGOR hung up the little jacket and the shoes for a scare-crow to frighten the blackbirds. PETER never stopped running ';
say = say + ' or looked behind him till he got home to the big fir-tree. ';
say = say + 'He was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice soft sand on the floor of the rabbit-hole, and shut his eyes. ';
say = say + 'His mother was busy cooking; she wondered what he had done with his clothes. It was the second little jacket and ';
say = say + 'pair of shoes that Peter had lost in a fortnight! I AM sorry to say that Peter was not very well during the evening. ';
say = say + 'His mother put him to bed, and made some camomile tea; and she gave a dose of it to Peter! ';
say = say + '"One table-spoonful to be taken at bed-time." BUT Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail had bread and milk and blackberries, for supper. ';
